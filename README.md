## Overview

This is the C++ application with the concept of the XOR encryption which will encrypt the content
of the file and save in the same file. All what you need to do is just pass the file location path 
when it prompt to ask you to enter the path.

It is really very useful to protect the data from the unauthorized person as you can use the key as the 
password to protect the data. The person who want to decrypt should know the key.
